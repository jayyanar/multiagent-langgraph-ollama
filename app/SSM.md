Create a JUnit 5 test class in Java 17 named `Claim2MaintenanceTest`.  
The test should validate the logic of the `Claim2Maintenance` class.  
Additionally, the test should iterate over all 21 BDD scenario files located in the `./BDD/` folder.  
Each file contains BDD-style scenarios in Gherkin format.  
For each file, extract relevant input and expected output, execute the corresponding method in `Claim2Maintenance`, and assert that the output matches the expectation.  
Use parameterized tests or dynamic test generation if needed.  
Ensure proper logging and error messages for failed assertions.
