Title: Orchestrating Intelligence: Context Engineering Strategies for Multi-Agent Workflow
Category - Generative AI

Abstract

This session delves into context engineering techniques that enable effective orchestration of multi-agent workflows. It covers how agents can share memory, align goals, and coordinate tasks using structured prompts and contextual cues. The strategies discussed help build scalable, intelligent systems for complex, collaborative environments across domains like finance, healthcare, and logistics.


What will be learn by end of session
Attendees will learn how to design and implement effective context engineering strategies to orchestrate multi-agent systems. They will understand how to think beyond prompt engineering or template and enable collaboration through shared memory, structured prompts, and contextual alignment—empowering scalable, intelligent workflows across industries like finance, healthcare, and logistics.

 - From Prompting to Partnering: How Agentic Coding Transforms Vibe into Velocity

https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices

Abstract: Agentic coding represents the next leap in software development—moving beyond simple prompt-and-response tools to collaborative, autonomous systems that plan, reason, and execute alongside developers. This session explores how agentic workflows accelerate productivity, enhance code quality, and shift AI from passive assistant to active engineering partner. Learn how this transformation takes us from experimentation and "vibes" to structured, high-velocity development.

What will be learn by end of session
* Core principles of Agentic coding
* Real-world workflows and patterns
* How to integrate agents into your development loop

I already delivered same kind of session in AWS Summit Bengaluru 2025
